# The Dark - An Immersive iOS Experience üåü

> *"In a world where screens are just pixels, we bring you an experience that you can feel..."* 

## üé¨ The Story Behind

Inspired by Apple's groundbreaking "world's first haptic movie trailer" for "F1: The Movie" at WWDC 2025, I set out to explore the fascinating world of haptic feedback and sound design. This project is my journey into creating an immersive experience that goes beyond the visual - it's something you can feel.

## üéÆ What's This All About?

"The Dark" is an iOS and VisionOS app that transforms your device into a canvas of hidden content, revealed through the magic of:
- Dynamic lighting effects
- Synchronized haptic feedback
- Ambient sound design
- Interactive gestures

Think of it as a digital treasure hunt where you use light to discover secrets in the darkness. It's like having a magical torch in your pocket! üî¶

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Deep Dive

### Core Technologies
- SwiftUI for the UI
- Core Haptics for tactile feedback
- AVFoundation for sound design
- Custom animations and transitions

### Key Features
1. **Interactive Lighting System**
   - Dynamic light intensity based on touch position
   - Smooth transitions and ripple effects
   - Ambient light diffusion

2. **Haptic Feedback Engine**
   - Synchronized haptic patterns
   - Intensity-based feedback
   - Custom haptic waveforms

3. **Sound Design**
   - Ambient sound effects
   - Synchronized audio-haptic feedback
   - Dynamic sound mixing

## üéØ The Challenge

I've left some intentional gaps and opportunities for improvement. Here's your chance to contribute and make this experience even better!

### Known Issues & Opportunities
1. **Launch Screen Enhancement**
   - The default launch screen needs some love
   - Opportunity to create a more engaging first impression

2. **Sound System Tweaks**
   - `playTorchOn()` works like a charm, but `playTorchOff()` needs some debugging
   - Perfect chance to dive into audio session management

3. **Splash Screen Evolution**
   - Current text-based welcome screen could be more dynamic
   - Challenge: Replace text with animated images
   - Add slow-motion effects and tire-scratching sound design

4. **Reset Functionality**
   - Add a reset button to the light screen
   - Create a smooth transition back to darkness
   - Implement state management for the reset

5. **Your Ideas!**
   - This is where your creativity comes in
   - Add features you think would enhance the experience
   - Experiment with new haptic patterns or sound designs

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `The Dark.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run on your iOS device (haptics work best on physical devices)

## ü§ù Contributing

This project is open for contributions! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, or improving documentation, your input is valuable. Here's how you can help:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch
3. Commit your changes
4. Push to the branch
5. Create a Pull Request

## üì± Requirements

- iOS 15.0+
- Xcode 13.0+
- Swift 5.5+
- Physical iOS device for full haptic experience

## üé® Design Philosophy

This project follows Apple's design principles for audio-haptic experiences:
- Causality: Clear relationship between action and feedback
- Harmony: Synchronized audio, haptic, and visual elements
- Utility: Meaningful feedback that enhances the experience
